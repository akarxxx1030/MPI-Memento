# MPI-Memento
Involves a brief list of Message Passing Interface (MPI) programs I had worked on in my Summer School at IIT Palakkad, June 2023.
The list of programs consists of a few example programs to understand language constructs and benefits MPI provides to the programmer, before diving into more powerful and relavant use cases.

MPI constructs effectively utilised in Matrix Addition, Matrix Multiplication, Merge Sort and Prefix Sum algorithms.

The above programs/algorithms were run on the Paramvidya Supercomputer Node @ IIT Palakkad courtesy of Centre for Design of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) and submit jobs were accordingly created through a testscript.
